# Parasite-Evolution-of-Host-Manipulation
We are interested in how trophically transmitted parasites may evolve to manipulate their intermediate prey host to facilitate transmission to the final predator host. 
Our key aim was to find the conditions under which manipulation will evolve when manipulation is put in a trade-off with spore production rate. 
We vary each of the model parameters and look at how the singular strategy and the population dynamics are affected.

In this code, we present how the CSS points are calculated using a numerical routine reliant on Floquet theory. 
We also present contour plots that show the period of the infected prey host dynamics. 

The code presented here was modified from that of Best & Ashby (2023) and the formal method came from work by Ferris & Best (2018, 2019).
